### Getting the project up and Running

Prior to running yarn start please run:

### `yarn install`

Then run

### `yarn start`

### Starting your first story

Stories will be completed by level. Starting at level 1.

This first story in level one starts after you have your server up and running.

The server will have a splashscreen with a one player button that takes you to the "Game" component where you will begin
building your game. 

### Example tests

There are some basic example tests for the splashscreen to help get you started.
